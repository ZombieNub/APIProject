# APIProject
IRC bot that fetches the weather. Built to learn and practice APIs.

This project creates an IRC bot that has two commands: !weather <zip/city> and !exit. !weather <zip/city> fetches the weather data in a region, either by zip code or city depending on the input. Exit shuts down the bot. This project was made to learn APIs, the URL class in Java, and function composition with monads.

This project was made as part of an optional assignment for a CS course. I found it a fascinating exercise, and learned a lot about Java, functional programming, APIs, and git.
